# Animations and exam

Today, we added some animations to this website, pretty simple using a tiny bit of javascript and css's transition property.

Oh, and also, i needed to give some time to study for my physics exam tommorow. Hopefully, it won't be that hard.

Now that i have added animation, i was thinking we could add a subtle background, something geometric, like hexagons or something might look good.

For now, i guess we can just sleep.
