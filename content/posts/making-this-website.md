# New Website, Yay?

So, I have made a new website and uploaded it to github and i am going to be using this as a general platfrom to keep myself a little organised.

Now, to fill this empty space beneath this text, lets walk through how i went about creating this beautiful masterpiece that is definitely not made using a template

## The previous website

As you may have noticed, there was a website on this domain before this one.

The first version was made with pure HTML, CSS and javascript, no React, no frontend framework, and i was quite proud of it since it had a pretty interesting background effect going on.

I don't recommend doing this unless you want to learn the basics of the above mentioned languages, you will need to spend hours to make something without a framework which can be made in 5 minutes using a framework

I do, however recommend that you do make a website without any framework as it was an incredible learning process. The previous version of this website is available in the git history.

## The current website

This website was made using hugo and the PaperMod theme, the links for which can be found in the footer of this page (and any page on this website).
And this was hosted on github using github-pages
