# Exams and Diary

Today was my first exam of college and i guess i am going to be using this website as a sort of diary...

## Exams

Today was my physics exam, the first exam of my college, i was a little anxious about it but it wasn't all that hard, I guess we will see when the result comes.

## Diary

I guess i am using this website as a diary, i have never written a diary before this in my life, let's see where this is going, and how long i will continue to add entries.

### Website

No style changes were made on this website, i was looking at code snippets for implementing a hexagonal pattern as a background, but decided that it would make the website too crowded.
